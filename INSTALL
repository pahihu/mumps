                        MUMPS Version 1.70DEV

  This version of mumps runs on FreeBSD, NetBSD, many linux versions,
  OSX 10.4 through 10.9 in 64 and 32 bit mode and Solaris even on 
  big-endian machines.  This version is also available for windows 
  (tested on XP and Windows 7) and on the Raspberry Pi (ARM) processor 
  (for embeded MUMPS).

  First select a directory (such as your home directory) that does NOT
  contain a directory or file named mumps.
  
  Change to this directory and type make.  The resulting mumps executable
  will be optimised for this system.

  NOTE: On cygwin, first follow the instructions below and for NetBSD it may
	be necessary to copy BSDmakefile to Makefile.

	On cygwin and solaris, $H is GMT as these implementations don't have
	a local time offset.

  To use, first create a database, eg:
	./mumps -v TEST -b 16 -s 1000 testdb

  then, start the environment, eg:
	./mumps -j2 testdb

  then, load the unitities, eg:
	./mumps -x 'O 1:("utils":"R") U 1 R X X X' testdb

  The environment is then started using:
	./mumps testdb
  or
	./mumps -x "D ^%M" testdb

  Remember to shut it down when you are done to free the shared memory.
  Do either M> K ^$J or MCL> D ^SSD

  		NOTES on cygwin

  For windows, install the Cygwin environment at http://cygwin.com/install.html

  Run cygwin terminal (on win7 or win8 run it as administrator).

  Setup the Cygserver using /usr/bin/cygserver-config.



    Enjoy
